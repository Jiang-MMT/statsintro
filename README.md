Introduction to Statistics
--------------------------

I have now finished my book on an "Introduction to Statistics with Python",
and it will appear with Springer approximately in January 2016. The
corresponding git-repo - which is essentially the continuation of this repo - is 

https://github.com/thomas-haslwanter/statsintro_python.git

which also contains the IPython Notebooks that go with this manuscript.

For the book the manuscript has been significantly extended, corrected, and
improved. For a short time, an outdated version of the manuscript will still be
available under http://work.thaslwanter.at/Stats/html/ 
I hope that when I have to take that manuscript offline, I will be able to
interest you in the full version of the book.

Python rocks - also for statistical tasks!
