  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this evidence-based analysis is to determine the effectiveness and cost of CIMT for persons with arm dysfunction after a stroke.CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION A stroke is a sudden loss of brain function caused by the interruption of blood flow to the brain (ischemic stroke) or the rupture of blood vessels in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). A stroke can affect any number of areas including the ability to move, see, remember, speak, reason, and read and write. Stroke is the leading cause of adult neurological disability in Canada; 300,000 people or 1\% of the population live with its effects. Up to 85\% of persons experiencing a complete stroke have residual arm dysfunction which will interfere with their ability to live independently. Rehabilitation interventions are the cornerstone of care and recovery after a stroke. CONSTRAINT-INDUCED MOVEMENT THERAPY: Constraint-Induced Movement (CIMT) is a behavioural approach to neurorehabilitation based on the principle of 'learned non-use'. The term is derived from studies in nonhuman primates in which somatosensory deafferentation of a single forelimb was performed and after which the animal then failed to use that limb. This failure to use the limb was deemed 'learned non-use'. The major components of CIMT include: i) intense repetitive task-oriented training of the impaired limb ii) immobilization of the unimpaired arm, and iii) shaping. With regard to the first component, persons may train the affected arm for several hours a day for up to 10-15 consecutive days. With immobilization, the unaffected arm may be restrained for up to 90\% of waking hours. And finally, with shaping, the difficulty of the training tasks is progressively increased as performance improves and encouraging feedback is provided immediately when small gains are achieved.What is the effectiveness and cost of CIMT compared with physiotherapy and/or occupational therapy rehabilitative care for the treatment of arm dysfunction after stroke in persons 18 years of age and older?A literature search was performed on January 21, 2011 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, OVID EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. (Appendix 1) A preliminary search completed in August 2010 found a Cochrane Systematic review published in 2009. As a result, the literature search for this evidence-based analysis was designed to include studies published from January 1, 2008 to January 21, 2011.Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials with or without meta-analysis.Study participants 18 years of age and older with arm dysfunction after stroke.Studies comparing the use of CIMT with occupational therapy and/or physiotherapy rehabilitative care (usual care) to improve arm function.STUDIES WHICH DESCRIBED CIMT AS HAVING THE FOLLOWING THREE COMPONENTS: i) restraining unimpaired arm and/or wrist with a sling, hand splint or cast; ii) intensive training with functional task practice of the affected arm; iii) application of shaping methodology during training.

Significant differences were also found in three of the five secondary outcome measures including Arm Motor Impairment and Perceived Motor Function Amount of Use and Quality of Use. There was a nonsignificant effect found with the FIM score and the quality of life Stroke Impact Scale outcome measure. The nonsignificant effect found with the scale score and the quality of life score may be a factor of a nonresponsive outcome measure (FIM scale) and/or a type II statistical error from an inadequate sample size. The quality of evidence was moderate for arm motor function and low for all other outcome measures except quality of life, which was very low.

The visual vertical was assessed by asking the subjects to align a target line to earth vertical by means of remote control. Postural vertical judgments were obtained by exposing them to rotational displacements in the roll plane while sitting on a motor-driven chair and requiring them to align their body to vertical using a joystick control. While the patients showed strong deviations of the visual vertical towards the lesion side, their postural vertical judgments remained veridical. We conclude that the above perceptions are not processed identically and that the participating sensory systems are differently weighted during these tasks.},

  Abstract                 = {Horizontal and vertical smooth pursuit was compared with otolith-ocular responses in 11 patients with cerebellar ataxia and 21 normal subjects using three-dimensional magnetic search coil eye movement recordings. Otolith-ocular responses were investigated during off-vertical axis rotation. This stimulus induces nystagmus consisting of the exponentially decaying canalicular response, and an eye-velocity modulation and offset which arise from the excitation of the otoliths by the gravity vector, which lasts as long as the rotation continues. Otolith-ocular reflexes are intimately interrelated with visual tracking when real targets are viewed during linear motion. The responses of both the translational vestibulo-ocular reflex and the pursuit system have been shown to be linearly dependent on the inverse of the viewing distance, so that a common central pathway for the two systems has been suggested, probably travelling through the cerebellum. Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate to what extent these reflexes are disturbed in cerebellar disease. The results confirm the earlier notion that in normal subjects pursuit performance is better for horizontal than for vertical tracking, and that it is better for upward than for downward tracking. This pattern is also found in patients. In addition, smooth pursuit performance is clearly degraded in patients, but the modulation of eye-velocity during off-vertical axis rotation is enhanced. Since the amount of this enhancement does not correlate with the amount of pursuit impairment, degradation of smooth pursuit and pathological enhancement of otolith-ocular responses seem to be independent effects of cerebellar degeneration. Thus, the increase in the otolith-ocular response in patients cannot be attributed to adaptational mechanisms trying to overcome the smooth pursuit deficiency; it is more likely to represent pathological disinhibition of otolith derived responses. The absence of compensatory eye-velocity offset during off-vertical axis rotation may reflect the fact that in patients the otolith signals are not utilized in computations thought to be important for spatial orientation mechanisms arising from the interaction of vestibular, visual and somatosensory signals.},

  Abstract                 = {1. We studied the three-dimensional input-output human vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) kinematics after selective loss of semicircular canal (SCC) function either through total unilateral vestibular deafferentation (uVD) or through single posterior SCC occlusion (uPCO), and showed large deficits in magnitude and direction in response to high-acceleration head rotations (head "impulses"). 2. A head impulse is a passive, unpredictable, high-acceleration (3,000-4,000 degrees/s2) head rotation through an amplitude of 10-20 degrees in roll, pitch, or yaw. The subjects were tested while seated in the upright position and focusing on a fixation target. Head and eye rotations were measured with the use of dual search coils, and were expressed as rotation vectors. A three-dimensional vector analysis was performed on the input-output VOR kinematics after uVD, to produce two indexes in the time domain: magnitude and direction. Magnitude is expressed as speed gain (G) and direction as misalignment angle (delta). 3. G. after uVD, was significantly lower than normal in both directions of head rotation during roll, pitch, and yaw impulses, and were much lower during ipsilesional than during contralesional roll and yaw impulses. At 80 ms from the onset of an impulse (i.e., near peak head velocity), G was 0.23 +/- 0.08 (SE) (ipsilesional) and 0.56 +/- 0.08 (contralesional) for roll impulses, 0.61 +/- 0.09 (up) and 0.72 +/- 0.10 (down) for pitch impulses, and 0.36 +/- 0.06 (ipsilesional) and 0.76 +/- 0.09 (contralesional) for yaw impulses (mean +/- 95\% confidence intervals). 4. delta, after uVD, was significantly different from normal during ipsilesional roll and yaw impulses and during pitch-up and pitch-down impulses. delta was normal during contralesional roll and yaw impulses. At 80 ms from the onset of the impulse, delta was 30.6 +/- 4.5 (ipsilesional) and 13.4 +/- 5.0 (contralesional) for roll impulses, 23.7 +/- 3.7 (up) and 31.6 +/- 4.4 (down) for pitch impulses, and 68.7 +/- 13.2 (ipsilesional) and 11.0 +/- 3.3 (contralesional) for yaw impulses (mean +/- 95\% confidence intervals). 5. VOR gain (gamma), after uVD, were significantly lower than normal for both directions of roll, pitch, and yaw impulses and much lower during ipsilesional than during contralesional roll and yaw impulses. At 80 ms from the onset of the head impulse, the gamma was 0.22 +/- 0.08 (ipsilesional) and 0.54 +/- 0.09 (contralesional) for roll impulses, 0.55 +/- 0.09 (up) and 0.61 +/- 0.09 (down) for pitch impulses, and 0.14 +/- 0.10 (ipsilesional) and 0.74 +/- 0.06 (contralesional) for yaw impulses (mean +/- 95\% confidence intervals). Because gamma is equal to [G*cos (delta)], it is significantly different from its corresponding G during ipsilesional roll and yaw, and during all pitch impulses, but not during contralesional roll and yaw impulses. 6. After uPCO, pitch-vertical gamma during pitch-up impulses was reduced to the same extent as after uVD; roll-torsional gamma during ipsilesional roll impulses was significantly lower than normal but significantly higher than after uVD. At 80 ms from the onset of the head impulse, gamma was 0.32 +/- 0.13 (ipsilesional) and 0.55 +/- 0.16 (contralesional) for roll impulses, 0.51 +/- 0.12 (up) and 0.91 +/- 0.14 (down) for pitch impulses, and 0.76 +/- 0.06 (ipsilesional) and 0.73 +/- 0.09 (contralesional) for yaw impulses (mean +/- 95\% confidence intervals). 7. The eye rotation axis, after uVD, deviates in the yaw plane, away from the normal interaural axis, toward the nasooccipital axis, during all pitch impulses. After uPCO, the eye rotation axis deviates in same direction as after uVD during pitch-up impulses, but is well aligned with the head rotation axis during pitch-down impulses.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigated the three-dimensional spatial characteristics of caloric nystagmus during excitation and inhibition of the lateral semicircular canal in five normal human subjects. Each subject was repositioned in 45 degrees steps at 1-min intervals such that the right lateral semicircular canal plane was reoriented in pitch, from 135 degrees backwards from the upright position to 135 degrees forwards, while the right ear was continuously stimulated with air at 44 degrees C. In orientations in which caloric stimulus resulted in excitation of the right lateral semicircular canal, the eye velocity axis was orthogonal to the average orientation of the right lateral semicircular canal plane. However, in orientations in which caloric stimulus resulted in inhibition of the right lateral semicircular canal, the eye velocity axis was orthogonal to the average orientation of the left and not the right lateral semicircular canal plane. These findings suggest that velocity and direction of caloric nystagmus depend not only on the absolute magnitude of vestibular activity on the stimulated side but also on the differences in activity between the left and right vestibular nuclei, most probably mediated centrally via brainstem commissural pathways.},

  Abstract                 = {Modulation of the caloric nystagmus in response to repositioning the plane of one vertical semicircular canal from gravitational horizontal to vertical during continuous caloric stimulation was used to measure the vertical canal's contribution to the nystagmus. The rationale was to examine the thermovective response from one vertical canal at a time, after a temperature gradient had been established across its two limbs. The nystagmus was measured and analysed in three dimensions using orthogonal head-referenced coordinates. The magnitude of each semicircular canal's contribution to the overall caloric response, the canal vector, was determined in non-orthogonal, contravariant semicircular canal plane coordinates. By using the canal plane reorientation technique and contravariant canal plane coordinates, we were able to measure the proportional thermovective response magnitude generated by each vertical canal during caloric stimulation. We found that the anterior canal contributed about one-third and the posterior canal about one-tenth as much as the lateral canal did to the overall caloric response magnitude when it was reoriented from horizontal to vertical. Comparison of the eye rotation axis before and after each vertical canal plane reorientation, with the geometry of the stimulated semicircular canals, also showed directional modulation of the caloric nystagmus by the vertical canal response. When one vertical canal plane was horizontal during caloric stimulation, the eye rotation axis aligned with the resultant of the other vertical canal and the lateral canal response axes. After vertical canal plane reorientation, the eye rotation axis realigned towards the resultant of the maximally stimulated vertical canal and the lateral canal, by 55.2+/-33.9 degrees (mean+/-SD) after anterior canal plane reorientation and by 32.3+/-21.2 degrees after posterior canal reorientation.},

The kinematics of the human angular vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) in three dimensions was investigated in 12 normal subjects during high-acceleration head rotations (head "impulses"). A head impulse is a passive, unpredictable, high-acceleration (3,000-4,000 degrees/s2) head rotation of approximately 10-20 degrees in roll, pitch, or yaw, delivered with the subject in the upright position and focusing on a fixation target. Head and eye rotations were measured with dual search coils and expressed as rotation vectors. The first of these two papers describes a vector analysis of the three-dimensional input-output kinematics of the VOR as two indexes in the time domain: magnitude and direction. 2. Magnitude is expressed as speed gain (G) and direction as misalignment angle (delta). G is defined as the ratio of eye velocity magnitude (eye speed) to head velocity magnitude (head speed). delta is defined as the instantaneous angle by which the eye rotation axis deviates from perfect alignment with the head rotation axis in three dimensions. When the eye rotation axis aligns perfectly with the head rotation axis and when eye velocity is in a direction opposite to head velocity, delta = 0. The orientation of misalignment between the head and the eye rotation axes is characterized by two spatial misalignment angles, which are the projections of delta onto two orthogonal coordinate planes that intersect at the head rotation axis. 3. Time series of G were calculated for head impulses in roll, pitch, and yaw. At 80 ms after the onset of an impulse (i.e., near peak head velocity), values of G were 0.72 +/- 0.07 (counterclockwise) and 0.75 +/- 0.07 (clockwise) for roll impulses, 0.97 +/- 0.05 (up) and 1.10 +/- 0.09 (down) for pitch impulses, and 0.95 +/- 0.06 (right) and 1.01 +/- 0.07 (left) for yaw impulses (mean +/- 95\% confidence intervals). 4. The eye rotation axis was well aligned with head rotation axis during roll, pitch, and yaw impulses: delta remained almost constant at approximately 5-10 degrees, so that the spatial misalignment angles were < or = 5 degrees. delta was 9.6 +/- 3.1 (counterclockwise) and 9.0 +/- 2.6 (clockwise) for roll impulses, 5.7 +/- 1.6 (up) and 6.1 +/- 1.9 (down) for pitch impulses, and 6.2 +/- 2.2 (right) and 7.9 +/- 1.5 (left) for yaw impulses (mean +/- 95\% confidence intervals). 5. VOR gain (gamma) is the product of G and cos(delta). Because delta is small in normal subjects, gamma is not significantly different from G. At 80 ms after the onset of an impulse, gamma was 0.70 +/- 0.08 (counterclockwise) and 0.74 +/- 0.07 (clockwise) for roll impulses, 0.97 +/- 0.05 (up) and 1.09 +/- 0.09 (down) for pitch impulses, and 0.94 +/- 0.06 (right) and 1.00 +/- 0.07 (left) for yaw impulses (mean +/- 95\% confidence intervals). 6. VOR latencies, estimated with a latency shift method, were 10.3 +/- 1.9 (SD) ms for roll impulses, 7.6 +/- 2.8 (SD) ms for pitch impulses, and 7.5 +/- 2.9 (SD) ms for yaw impulses. 7. We conclude that the normal VOR produces eye rotations that are almost perfectly compensatory in direction as well as in speed, but only during yaw and pitch impulses. During roll impulses, eye rotations are well aligned in direction, but are approximately 30\% slower in speed.},

  Abstract                 = {Reaching for an object while simultaneously rotating induces Coriolis and centrifugal inertial forces on the arm that require compensatory actions to maintain accuracy. We investigated whether the nervous system uses vestibular signals of head rotation to predict inertial forces. Human subjects reached in darkness to a remembered target 33 cm distant. Subjects were stationary, but experienced a strong vestibular rotation signal. We achieved this by rotating subjects at 360 degrees /s in yaw for 2 min and then stopping, and subjects reached during the 'post-rotary' period when the deceleration is interpreted by the vestibular system as a rotation in the opposite direction. Arm trajectories were straight in control trials without a rotary stimulus. With vestibular stimulation, trajectory curvature increased an average of 3 cm in the direction of the vestibular stimulation (e.g., to the right for a rightward yaw stimulus). Vestibular-induced curvature returned rapidly to normal, with an average time constant of 6 s. Movements also became longer as the vestibular stimulus diminished, and returned towards normal length with an average time constant of 5.6 s. In a second experiment we compared reaching with preferred and non-preferred hands, and found that they were similarly affected by vestibular stimulation. The reach curvatures were in the expected direction if the nervous system anticipated and attempted to counteract the presence of Coriolis forces based on the vestibular signals. Similarly, the shorter reaches may have occurred because the nervous system was attempting to compensate for an expected centrifugal force. Since vestibular stimulation also alters the perceived location of targets, vestibular signals probably influence all stages of the sensorimotor pathway transforming the desired goal of a reach into specific motor-unit innervation.},

Subjects were held in different head/body tilts in roll and pitch for 35 s while we measured 3D eye position with scleral coils, and we used methods that reduced torsion artifacts produced by the eyelids pressing on the contact lens and exit wire. 3D eye positions were described by planar fits to the data (Listing's plane), and changes in these planes showed how torsion varied with head position. Similar to findings in monkeys, the eyes counterrolled during roll tilts independent of horizontal and vertical eye position, reaching a maximum torsion of 4.9 degrees. Counterroll was not proportional to the shear force on the macula of the utricles: gain (torsion/sine of the head roll angle) decreased by 50\% from near upright to ear down. During pitch forward, torsion increased when subjects looked right, and decreased when they looked left. However, the maximum change of torsion was only -0.06 degrees per degree of horizontal eye position, which is less than reported in monkey. Also in contrast to monkey, we found little change in torsion when subjects were pitched backwards.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe in detail the frequency response of the human three-dimensional angular vestibulo-ocular response (3-D aVOR) over a frequency range of 0.05-1 Hz. Gain and phase of the human aVOR were determined for passive head rotations in the dark, with the rotation axis either aligned with or perpendicular to the direction of gravity (earth-vertical or earth-horizontal). In the latter case, the oscillations dynamically stimulated both the otolith organs and the semi-circular canals. We conducted experiments in pitch and yaw, and compared the results with previously-published roll data. Regardless of the axis of rotation and the orientation of the subject, the gain in aVOR increased with frequency to about 0.3 Hz, and was approximately constant from 0.3 to 1 Hz. The aVOR gain during pitch and yaw rotations was larger than during roll rotations. Otolith and canal cues combined differently depending upon the axis of rotation: for torsional and pitch rotations, aVOR gain was higher with otolith input; for yaw rotations the aVOR was not affected by otolith stimulation. There was a phase lead in all three dimensions for frequencies below 0.3 Hz when only the canals were stimulated. For roll and pitch rotations this phase lead vanished with dynamic otolith stimulation. In contrast, the horizontal phase showed no improvement with additional otolith input during yaw rotations. The lack of a significant otolith contribution to the yaw aVOR was observed when subjects were supine, prone or lying on their sides. Our results confirm studies with less-natural stimuli (off-vertical axis rotation) that the otoliths contribute a head-rotation signal to the aVOR. However, the magnitude of the contribution depends on the axis of rotation, with the gain in otolith-canal cross-coupling being smallest for yaw axis rotations. This could be because, in humans, typical yaw head movements will stimulate the otoliths to a much lesser extent then typical pitch and roll head movements.},

  Abstract                 = {The semi-circular canals and the otolith organs both contribute to gaze stabilization during head movement. We investigated how these sensory signals interact when they provide conflicting information about head orientation in space. Human subjects were reoriented 90 degrees in pitch or roll during long-duration, constant-velocity rotation about the earth-vertical axis while we measured three-dimensional eye movements. After the reorientation, the otoliths correctly indicated the static orientation of the subject with respect to gravity, while the semicircular canals provided a strong signal of rotation. This rotation signal from the canals could only be consistent with a static orientation with respect to gravity if the rotation-axis indicated by the canals was exactly parallel to gravity. This was not true, so a cue-conflict existed. These conflicting stimuli elicited motion sickness and a complex tumbling sensation. Strong horizontal, vertical, and/or torsional eye movements were also induced, allowing us to study the influence of the conflict between the otoliths and the canals on all three eye-movement components. We found a shortening of the horizontal and vertical time constants of the decay of nystagmus and a trend for an increase in peak velocity following reorientation. The dumping of the velocity storage occurred regardless of whether eye velocity along that axis was compensatory to the head rotation or not. We found a trend for the axis of eye velocity to reorient to make the head-velocity signal from the canals consistent with the head-orientation signal from the otoliths, but this reorientation was small and only observed when subjects were tilted to upright. Previous models of canal-otolith interaction could not fully account for our data, particularly the decreased time constant of the decay of nystagmus. We present a model with a mechanism that reduces the velocity-storage component in the presence of a strong cue-conflict. Our study, supported by other experiments, also indicates that static otolith signals exhibit considerably smaller effects on eye movements in humans than in monkeys.},

One source of adaptation could be the ability of sensory-motor systems to compensate for the vestibular loss by adaptive enhancement of their performance. We studied smooth-pursuit eye movements in five patients and six healthy control subjects using a step-ramp paradigm. Eye movements were measured with scleral search coils. Patients showed open- and closed-loop pursuit gains that were about 9\% higher than controls. We suggest that the challenge of living with a deficient vestibular system caused an enhancement in the pursuit system, which contributes to the patient's overall compensation.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective: To investigate the beneficial and adverse effects of a mental practice intervention on activities, cognition, and emotion in patients after stroke, patients with Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis. Methods: Electronic databases PubMed/Medline, PEDro, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Rehadat, Embase, and Picarta were searched until June 2012. Fourteen randomized controlled trials in stroke and two randomized controlled trials in Parkinson's disease were included, representing 491 patients (421 with stroke). No randomized controlled trials in multiple sclerosis were identified. The methodologic quality of the included trials was assessed with the Amsterdam-Maastricht-Consensus-List (AMCL). Information on study characteristics and outcomes was summarized and evidence for effects described. Data from individual studies in stroke with same outcome measures were pooled. Results: The included 16 randomized controlled trials were heterogeneous and methodologic quality varied. Ten trials reported significant effects in favor of mental practice in patients with stroke (n = 9) and Parkinson's disease (n = 1). In six studies mental practice had similar effects as therapy as usual (n = 5 in stroke and n = 1 in Parkinson's disease). Of six performed meta-analyses with identical measures in stroke studies only two showed significant effects of mental practice: short-term improvement of arm-hand-ability (ARAT: SMD 0.62; 95\% CI: 0.05 to 1.19) and improvement of performance of activities (NRS: SMD 0.9; 95\% CI: 0.04 to 1.77). Five studies found effects on cognition (e.g., effects on attention, plan actions in unfamiliar surroundings) and four reported observed side-effects, both positive (e.g., might increase motivation and arousal and reduce depression) and negative (e.g., diminished concentration, irritation). Conclusions: Mental practice might have positive effects on performance of activities in patients with neurological diseases, but this review reports less positive results than earlier published ones. Strengths and limitations of past studies are pointed out. Methodologic recommendations for future studies are given.},

  Abstract                 = {To determine whether volitional effort on the part of the subject can influence the results of the Bielschowsky Head Tilt Test.Bielschowsky Head Tilt testing was performed in five normal subjects. Vertical amplitudes were measured with prism alternate cover testing when the head tilt was voluntary (volitionally maintained in a tilted position by the subject), forced (restrained in the tilted position by the examiner while the patient actively resisted) and active (restrained in a tilted position by the examiner with the subject actively trying to increase the tilt). Three-dimensional scleral search coil recordings were performed in three additional normal subjects using the same paradigm to determine the effect of volition on the torsional positions of the eyes.No vertical deviation of the eyes was detectable with prism alternate cover testing in any position of tilt, regardless of whether the tilt was voluntary, forced, or active. Volitional attempts to tilt the head were preceded by a transient ipsiversive torsional movement of the measured eye, which was quickly followed by a normal ocular counterroll. Following completion of the counterroll, the position of the eyes was constant for any position of head tilt, regardless of whether the tilt was forced, active, or voluntary.Anticipatory torsional movements of the eyes are evoked by an attempted volitional head movement in the roll plane and its associated innervation to the cervical musculature. However, these volitional movements do not alter the final torsional position of the eyes, which is a function of the degree of head tilt and the normal ocular counterroll. These anticipatory torsional movements do not influence the results of the Bielschowsky Head Tilt Test clinically by prism alternate cover testing.},

  Abstract                 = {In the last several years, a promising new approach has been suggested in the therapy of Ménière's disease (MD): the low-dose intratympanic gentamicin therapy. By titrating the desired vestibular inhibition by single injections and infrequent administration, side effects concerning hearing can be held on an acceptably low level, while disease-related symptoms are often successfully eliminated. However, it is still unclear if endolymphatic hydrops actually decreases when the patients become symptom free. In the literature, hydrops is significantly associated with an enhanced ratio of summating potential/action potential (SP/AP). Our aim in this retrospective study was to answer the question if pathologically high SP/AP ratios normalize after successful low-dose intratympanic gentamicin treatment. Twenty-eight patients with MD received one, two or three intratympanic gentamicin injections. These injections inhibited vertigo spells without causing additional hearing loss. SP/AP ratios measured by noninvasive electrocochleography did not improve statistically when patients became symptom free. This indicates that the beneficial effect of gentamicin does not depend on the improvement of SP/AP ratios. Considering the well-established correlation between increased SP/AP and active MD, it thus seems unlikely that gentamicin treatment significantly reduces hydrops.},

  Abstract                 = {The 3-dimensional angular vestibulo-ocular reflexes (AVOR) elicited by rapid rotary head thrusts were studied in 17 subjects with unilateral Ménière's disease before and 2-10 weeks after treatment with intratympanic gentamicin and in 13 subjects after surgical unilateral vestibular destruction (SUVD). Each head thrust was in the horizontal plane or in either diagonal plane of the vertical semicircular canals, so that each head thrust effectively stimulated only one pair of canals. The AVOR gains (eye velocity/head velocity during the 30 ms before peak head velocity) for the head thrusts exciting each individual canal were averaged and taken as a measure of the function of that canal. Prior to intratympanic gentamicin, gains for head thrusts that excited canals on the affected side were 0.91 +/- 0.20 (horizontal canal, HC), 0.78 +/- 0.20 (anterior canal, AC), and 0.83 +/- 0.10 (posterior canal, PC). The asymmetries between these gain values and those for head thrusts that excited the contralateral canals were <2\%. In contrast, caloric asymmetries averaged 40\% +/- 32\%. Intratympanic gentamicin resulted in decreased gains attributable to each canal on the treated side: 0.40 +/- 0.12 (HC), 0.35 +/- 0.14 (AC), 0.31 +/- 0.14 (PC) (p <0.01). However, the gains attributable to contralateral canals dropped only slightly, resulting in marked asymmetries between gains for excitation of ipsilateral canals versus their contralateral mates: HC: 34\% +/- 12\%, AC: 24\% +/- 25\%, and PC: 42\% +/- 13\%. There was no difference in the AVOR gain for excitation of the ipsilateral HC after gentamicin in patients who received a single intratympanic injection (0.39 +/- 0.11, n = 12) in comparison to those who received 2-3 injections (0.42 +/- 0.15, n = 5, p = 0.7). Gain decreases attributed to the gentamicin-treated HC and AC were not as severe as those observed after SUVD. This finding suggests that intratympanic gentamicin causes a partial vestibular lesion that may involve preservation of spontaneous discharge and/or rotational sensitivity of afferents.},

  Abstract                 = {The orientation of Listing's Plane (LP) was examined under one-g and zero-g conditions during parabolic flight. Ten healthy subjects participated in the experiment. In zero-g the orientation of LP was consistently altered. LP elevation was tilted backwards by approx. 10 degrees (p=0.003). The azimuth angles of the left and right eyes also diverged in zero-g, with a statistically significant change (p=0.04) in the vergence angle between 6.1 degrees and 11.8 degrees . A discernible dissociation in torsional eye position was also observed, which proved to be statistically significant (p=0.03). The thickness of LP was found to be of the order of 1 degrees , and was not significantly altered by the transitions between one-g and zero-g. Additional control experiments involving repeated measurements of LP under normal laboratory conditions demonstrated that the parameters of LP remain stable in the individual. The parabolic flight results demonstrate that in contrast to re-orientation in the one-g gravitational field, the elimination of gravity represents a qualitative change for the vestibular and oculomotor systems. It appears that given the lack of voluntary control of ocular torsion, the tonic otolith afferences are instrumental in the stabilisation of torsional eye position and consequently of Listing's Plane. The observed torsional divergence also provides support for the so-called otolith asymmetry hypothesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Dual search coils were used to record horizontal, vertical and torsional eye movement components of one eye during nystagmus caused by off-center yaw rotation (yaw centrifugation). Both normal healthy human subjects (n=7) and patients with only one functioning labyrinth (n=12) were studied in order to clarify how the concomitant linear acceleration affected the nystagmus response. Each subject was seated with head erect on the arm of a fixed-chair human centrifuge, 1 m away from the center of the rotation, and positioned to be facing along a radius; either towards (facing-in) or away from (facing-out) the center of rotation. Both yaw right and yaw left angular accelerations of 10 degrees s(-2) from 0 to 200 degrees/s were studied. During rotation a centripetal linear acceleration (increasing from 0 to 1.24xg units) was directed along the subject's naso-occipital axis resulting in a shift of the resultant angle of the gravitoinertial acceleration (GIA) of 51 degrees in the subject's pitch plane and an increase in the total GIA magnitude from 1.0 to 1.59xg. In normal subjects during the angular acceleration off-center there were, in addition to the horizontal eye velocity components, torsional and vertical eye velocities present. The magnitude of these additional components, although small, was larger than observed during similar experiments with on-center angular acceleration (Haslwanter et al. 1996), and the change in these components is attributed to the additional effect of the linear acceleration stimulation. In the pitch plane the average size of the shift of the axis of eye velocity (AEV) during the acceleration was about 8 degrees for a 51 degrees shift of the GIA (around 16\% of the GIA shift) so that the AEV-GIA alignment was inadequate. There was a very marked difference in the size of the AEV shift depending on whether the person was facing-in [AEV shift forward (i.e. non-compensatory) of about 4 degrees] or facing-out [AEV shift forward (i.e. compensatory) of around 12 degrees]. The linear acceleration decreased the time constant of decay of the horizontal component of the post-rotatory nystagmus: from an average of 24.8 degrees/s facing-in to an average of 11.3 degrees/s facing-out. The linear acceleration dumps torsional eye velocity in an manner analogous to, but independent of, the dumping of horizontal eye velocity. Patients with UVD had dramatically reduced torsional eye velocities for both facing-in and facing-out headings, and there was little if any shift of the AEV in UVD patients. The relatively small effects of linear acceleration on human canal-induced nystagmus found here confirms other recent studies in humans (Fetter et al. 1996) in contrast to evidence from monkeys and emphasizes the large and important differences between humans and monkeys in otolith-canal interaction. Our results confirm the vestibular control of the axis of eye velocity of humans is essentially head-referenced whereas in monkeys that control is essentially space-referenced.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative caloric testing is considered to be one of the most sensitive parameters in the diagnosis of peripheral vestibular disorders. In the past, because of limitations in the methods, the evaluation of the caloric response was restricted to mainly lateral semicircular canal functions. In this study, the authors tried to extend caloric testing to the function of all semicircular canals by using three-dimensional (3-D) analysis techniques.The authors studied in seven normal subjects 3-D eye movement responses to air caloric of the right ear with the subjects positioned in standard caloric position (lateral semicircular canal vertical) or such that one of the three semicircular canals of the right side was horizontal. Movement of the left eye was measured in 3-D with a dual-magnetic search coil. During stimulation, 10 seconds of maximum response were selected and desaccaded to yield the slow-phase velocity profile. From this profile, the average magnitude and direction of the eye rotation axis (velocity vector) were calculated in head coordinates.In all subjects, in standard caloric position, warm caloric produced eye velocity vectors that clustered closely along the direction expected from an excitation of the right lateral semicircular canal. When the subjects were positioned with one of the vertical semicircular canals horizontal, the orientation of the velocity vectors shifted toward a direction expected from the combined excitation of the lateral and the other vertical semicircular canal and vice versa.The 3-D eye movement recordings during caloric stimulation in different head positions allow the evaluation of the function of all semicircular canals.},

  Abstract                 = {The eye muscles in humans are arranged such that they allow rotations of the globe about any axis in three-dimensional space. Only 3D analysis techniques will suffice to describe the sometimes complex dependencies between the elicited eye movements and the stimulation conditions. With the recent availability of modern 3D eye movement measurement techniques and the further development of appropriate mathematical descriptions, we are now able to study eye movements in all three degrees of freedom. This article describes the basic mathematical tools for 3D eye movement analysis like rotation vectors, reference frames, coordinate systems, and the concept of Listing's law. In a second part some clinical applications are presented. The close coupling between the vestibular and the oculomotor system suggests that by observing spontaneous and elicited eye movements in the case of an acute unilateral vestibular pathology we might be able to find out which parts of the vestibular system (that is, which of the semicircular canals or which of the otoliths) are affected. The rationale of such an analysis is based on the observation that electrical stimulation of single semicircular canal afferents in animals induces eye movements that lie roughly in the plane of the canal. It is, therefore, possible to deduce which canals cause the eye movements observed when only some parts of the vestibular system are defective. Thus, the analysis of 3D movements not only provides an improved understanding of how the brain organizes movement in 3D space, but also has the potential to significantly improve our diagnostic capabilities.},

  Abstract                 = {The semicircular canals selectively transduce angular velocity and are normally insensitive to gravity and linear acceleration. In acute alcohol intoxication, however, the cupula becomes lighter than the endolymph, rendering it sensitive to gravity (buoyancy hypothesis). This results in positional alcohol nystagmus (PAN) and rotatory vertigo. We evaluated PAN in 8 normal subjects by means of three-dimensional eye-movement analysis in an attempt to clarify if the buoyancy mechanism is sufficient to explain PAN. Forty minutes after intake of 0.8 g of alcohol/kg of body weight, the subjects were positioned such that the lateral canals were earth vertical. They were then rotated in the plane of the lateral canals about an earth-horizontal axis to either 45 degrees or 90 degrees , right or left ear down, and eye movements were recorded for 40 seconds in each position. The spatial analysis of the responses showed that in addition to the nystagmus induced by the buoyancy of all six cupulae, alcohol intoxication also causes a vertical velocity offset (in all subjects, slow phase down) that is independent of the orientation of the subject in space. The offset may represent a toxic effect on central vestibular pathways, producing a tone imbalance of the vertical vestibulo-ocular reflex.},

It is shown how SEE++, a biomechanical model of the oculomotor plant that was built on the ideas of Miller and Robinson (1984) can improve the understanding of the effects of changes to the oblique eye muscles. By displaying only selected muscles, and by illustrating the relative contribution of these muscles through color-coding the bulb surface, the functional properties of the oblique muscles can be presented in a much clearer way. Investigating the effects of a hyperactive inferior oblique muscle shows that this type of model can help to clarify the functional cause of a pathology, which can otherwise be unclear, even for common pathologies.},

In addition to compensatory horizontal eye movements, significant vertical and torsional eye movement components were elicited. These vertical and torsional eye velocity traces led to a shift of the axis of eye velocity away from the axis of head velocity. Horizontal, vertical, and torsional velocity components showed clear differences between normals and patients with unilateral vestibular deafferentation. In normals, the axis of eye velocity tilted backward and slightly away from the axis of head velocity. Patients showed similar, but more pronounced, shifts during rotations toward the intact ear and shifts in the opposite direction for rotations toward the operated ear. Eye velocity traces were analyzed with special consideration given to the orientation of the axis of eye velocity.

Results of application to patients are given in the companion paper, and do not require an analytical understanding of the underlying mechanics.Using a simple biomechanical model for the oculomotor system and vector component analysis, the eye position dependent torque exerted by extraocular muscles on the eyeball was investigated. This model was applied to the healthy eye, as well as to different surgical procedures (Cuppers' Fadenoperation, Y-split muscle recessions, botulinum toxin, and simple muscle recessions).These investigations suggest that a Y-split muscle recession is a simple and efficient way to weaken ocular rectus muscles. Compared to alternative surgical procedures, undesired radial forces that can lead to post-surgical complications can be kept to a minimum. The authors further speculate that their good results may in part be because of possible preservation of proprioceptive inputs from the insertion of the extraocular muscle.},

  Abstract                 = {We recorded three-dimensional eye movements elicited by velocity steps about axes that were tilted with respect to the earth-vertical. Subjects were accelerated in 1 s from zero to 100 degrees/s, and the axis of rotation was tilted by 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, or 90 degrees. This stimulus induced a constant horizontal velocity component that was directed opposite to the direction of rotation, as well as a modulation of the horizontal, vertical and torsional components with the frequency of the rotation. The maximum steady-state response in the horizontal constant-velocity component was much smaller than in other species (about 6 degrees/s), reaching a maximum at a tilt angle of about 60 degrees. While the amplitude of the horizontal modulation component increased up to a tilt angle of 90 degrees (8.4 degrees/s), the vertical and torsional modulation amplitudes saturated around 60 degrees (ca. 2.5 degrees/s). At small tilt angles, the horizontal modulation component showed a small phase lag with respect to the chair position, which turned into a small phase lead at large tilt angles. The torsional component showed a phase lead that increased with increasing tilt angle. The vertical and torsional velocity modulation at large tilt angles was not predicted by a recent model of otolith-canal interaction by Merfeld. Agreement between model and experimental data could be achieved, however, by introducing a constant force along the body's z-axis to compensate for the gravitational pull on the otoliths in the head-upright position. This approach had been suggested previously to explain the direction of the perceived subjective vertical during roll under different g-levels, and produced in our model the observed vertical and torsional modulation components at large tilt angles.},

  Abstract                 = {We recorded three-dimensional eye and head movements during circular, horizontal, vertical, and torsional head shaking in six human subjects with normal vestibular function. With circular head shaking, the stimulation of the canals by the termination of the head movement is similar to that following a step in velocity about the naso-occipital axis. A large torsional nystagmus with slow phase eye velocity of about 20 degrees/s was observed upon cessation of circular head shaking. The three-dimensional eye movements expected from stimulation of the semicircular canals by the head-shaking maneuvers were calculated. The predicted activation of the canals was determined by projecting the head velocity (in head coordinates) into the canal planes and then processing the signal with the transfer function of the canals. The torsional eye velocity components predicted by the stimulation of the canals matched the recorded ones. We observed small horizontal eye velocities that could not be predicted by the stimulation of the canals alone. No eye movements were observed after the end of head shaking about a fixed horizontal or vertical axis. The eye velocities following the termination of head oscillations in the roll plane were small. The analysis methods developed for this study may be useful in the investigation of eye movements elicited by other types of three-dimensional head movements.},

At eccentric eye positions, the projection of the sampling window onto the image plane of the camera is translated and deformed due to the spherical shape of the eyeball. In this paper, we extend the polar cross-correlation technique by developing the formulas required to determine the correct location and shape of the sampling window at all eye positions. These formulas also allow the representation of three-dimensional eye position in Fick-angles, which are commonly used in oculomotor research. A numerical simulation shows the size of the errors in ocular torsion if the spherical geometry of the eye is not considered. Other effects which can affect the accuracy of video-based eye position measurements are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Simple diagnostic or therapeutic procedures can produce tremendous benefits for dizzy patients. To see how new ideas in the laboratory evolve into benefits for patients, an attempt to analyze how the corresponding information is distributed was made. To quantify that flow of information, a number of new scientific publications, citation numbers, and a number of new books on relevant subjects were looked at. For vertigo, this approach was facilitated by the fact that the diagnostic procedures for benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) and for canal paresis can be traced back to seminal publications. Results indicate that the current way of disseminating new information used here is working well, and that new ideas on diagnosis and treatment are readily available to practitioners. However, the application of new methods is limited by the availability of the required technology. It is conjectured that the technological requirements have become more complex over time, leading to a slower uptake of new technology.},

In this study, the hypothesis that the oblique muscles play an important role in the underlying biomechanical disorder of this type of strabismus was investigated.The hypothesis was tested by (1) a retrospective analysis of surgical results in one patient with unilateral axial high myopia; and (2) MR images of orbital tissues in two further patients with unilateral axial high myopia.MR images demonstrated a pattern of extraocular muscle path displacements similar to those described previously, but also a uniform decrease in the cross-sectional area of the inferior oblique muscles. Computer modeling required decreased inferior oblique contractility in addition to displaced extraocular muscle paths to recreate the observed motility pattern accurately.Patients with axial high myopia regularly show a reduction in the diameter of the inferior oblique. The resultant reduction in muscle-strength is important for the correct explanation of this complex eye movement disorder.},

  Abstract                 = {To investigate the dynamic effects of external forces on the displacement of the otolith membrane and subsequent neuronal responses of otoliths, we performed numerical analyses of otolith membrane displacements. In these studies we included the full geometry of the human otolith maculae, including their 3D curvature. The first part focuses on mechanical aspects of the otolith membrane. While it was found that the mechanical coupling of distant parts of the otolith membrane is only weak, these simulations indicate that curvature may have considerable local effects on displacements. They further suggest that the movements of the otoconia, embedded in the interotoconial matrix, show a resonance in a range between 100 and 2000 Hz. In the second part of the article we also investigate the tonic-phasic responses in the vestibular nerve emanating from hair cells in the striola region. Small head tilts away from head upright position are used. The simulations indicate that the direction of head tilt is coded in characteristic response patterns along the striola.},

  Abstract                 = {The transformation of head-movements into neural signals represents a multi-stage process. It depends on orientation and movement of the head, the geometry and mechanics of the vestibular sensors, and the ensuing processing of the peripheral vestibular signals. While this process is well understood for the semicircular canals, where each canal transduces the angular velocity in the corresponding canal plane, the contributions of the individual otoliths, our linear acceleration sensors, are still under debate. This is in part due to the complex geometrical structure of the otoliths. To improve our understanding of the otoliths, we have developed a new technique to visualize otolith function: using measured 3D-shapes of human otoliths and the observed 2D patterns of hair cell orientation over the epithelia, morphological polarization vectors are predicted. To visualize the geometric distribution of these vectors, we have created distribution plots which indicate the density of hair cell polarization vectors for the different directions. In many respects, our results closely agree with earlier recordings of polarization vectors of vestibular afferents in squirrel monkeys: for example, hair cells on the saccule do not cover the sagittal plane equally, but show a strong concentration in the dorso-ventral directions. Some discrepancies exist in the density distribution of otolith, which could provide valuable information for future anatomical investigations of the otoliths.},

The simulations were based on accurate measurements of the surfaces of human utricular and saccular maculae, which indicate a clear curvature of these surfaces. The results show that this curvature, a feature probably found in all mammals, has no effect on the mechanics of the structure as a whole since the elastic coupling in the otolith membrane is insufficient. Hair cell excitations on any place of the macula are only affected by the local orientation of the macula with respect to acceleration. Based on the displacements of the otolith membrane, we also calculated the induced activation patterns on the otolith epithelia. These patterns provide for the first time a complete image of peripheral otolith activity. The individual activation patterns at selected locations on the macula correspond well with single cell recordings of actual peripheral otolith neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {The perception of body position is mainly mediated by otolith information and visual cues. It has been shown, however, that proprioceptive sources are also involved. To distinguish between the contributions of the vestibular and nonvisual extra-vestibular information to graviception, we tested the effects of a stimulus that leaves the vestibular input unchanged but modifies the information from sense organs located more caudal along the trunk. This was achieved by bringing subjects into a horizontal ear-down position and rotating them around an earth-vertical axis that coincided with the interaural axis. In this paradigm, through centrifugal force, the stimulation of the vestibular and the putative extravestibular graviceptive organs in the body becomes dissociated. Healthy subjects (n = 14) and paraplegic patients with lesions between T4 and T8 (n = 7) adjusted themselves to the perceived horizontal right-ear down body position under two conditions: one with constant velocity rotation (ROT, velocity =120 degrees /s) around the earth-vertical axis of the turntable, and one without rotation (BASE). Among healthy subjects, the individual differences between BASE and ROT varied widely in both the feet-up or feet-down direction. In contrast, adjustments in paraplegic patients during ROT were always in the feet-down direction compared with BASE. A model with two extravestibular graviceptive sensors could explain our results: one sensor is located rostral to T4, and the other is caudal to T8. A load on the rostral graviceptor is interpreted as a tilt of the body in the feet-up direction and shifts the adjustments of perceived body position feet-down; a load on the caudal receptor is interpreted as a tilt in the feet-down direction and shifts the perceived body position feet-up. During ROT, healthy subjects solve the discrepant inputs of both extravestibular graviceptors in a highly variable manner, while paraplegic subjects show less variability because they are restricted to only the rostral graviceptor.},

  Abstract                 = {Earlier studies have reported temporal rotation of Listing's plane with convergence of the eyes causing torsion, which is dependent on eye elevation. The amount by which the planes rotate differs from study to study. To gain insight into the functional significance of the temporal tilt of Listing's plane for vision, we examined whether the rotation of the plane depends on the visual conditions, namely on the stimuli driving vergence. In different conditions, accommodative vergence, disparity-vergence, combinations of disparity with accommodation or depth perception were used and the resulting rotation of Listing's plane was measured. Our findings show, for the first time, that the relationship between convergence and Listing's-plane temporal rotation depends on the stimuli driving vergence. When the stimulus contains only disparity cues, vergence and Listing's plane rotate immediately and consistently among subjects. Accommodative vergence, the mutual couplings between vergence and accommodation, can influence the orientation of Listing's plane, but they do so in a idiosyncratic way. The largest rotation was elicited by stereograms combining disparity-vergence with depth perception. These findings support the idea of a functional role of Listing's plane rotation for binocular vision, perhaps for depth perception.},

For patients with high myopia, the situation becomes even more complex because the increase in the size of the bulb also affects the geometry of the oculomotor muscles. In this study, we wanted to investigate whether computer simulations of the oculomotor plant can be used to find accurate surgical parameters.In a retrospective study, we investigated pre- and postoperative strabismus patterns in 13 patients affected by convergent (seven patients) or divergent (six patients) strabismus and high myopia. Postoperative checks were made 1 day, 1 week, 3 months and 1-6 years after the operation. For each patient, we simulated the presurgical strabismus pattern with SEE++ (see 'Further Information' for manufacturer details), a biomechanical simulation program of the oculomotor plant. The individual results of the simulations were then compared to the measured postoperative strabismus patterns.We found a trend of under-correction in the postoperative situation, resulting in four patients having a large remaining strabismus angle of more than 5 degrees. The computer simulations were able to reproduce this under-correction, and suggested an increase in dosage.We conclude that realistic biomechanical simulations of the oculomotor plant can predict the postoperative result for myopic patients accurately. The results of the computer simulation correlate well with the postoperative outcome of the patient.},

We measured the gain of the aVOR elicited by rapid rotary head thrusts in each of the canal planes for each subject before and after treatment with intratympanic gentamicin by using magnetic search coils to record eye movements.During the follow-up period, 11 subjects ("single-treatment group"; 61\%) had control of their vertigo with a single gentamicin injection. The remaining 7 subjects ("multiple-treatment group"; 39\%) experienced recurrent vertigo that required a second injection of gentamicin at a mean of 6 months after the first treatment. The 11 subjects in the single-treatment group had significantly greater reduction of labyrinthine function after the first treatment, as measured by change in ipsilateral horizontal canal gain, than did the 7 subjects with vertigo recurrence. Changes in caloric asymmetry did not correlate with vertigo control.Our results suggest that successful treatment of Meniere's disease is closely related to attenuation of semicircular canal function as measured by horizontal canal aVOR gains.},

The presenting complaints in five of these patients were vertigo or dysequilibrium.The eye movement response to hyperventilation was a "recovery" nystagmus with slow-phase components corresponding to excitation of the affected vestibular nerve. Projection of the eye velocity vector into the plane of the semicircular canals revealed that fibers arising from the ampulla of the horizontal canal were most affected by hyperventilation with lesser activation of fibers to the superior canal and smaller, more variable responses from posterior canal fibers.The three-dimensional characteristics of the nystagmus evoked by hyperventilation in patients with vestibular schwannoma provide insight into the vestibular end organs affected by the tumor and the mechanism responsible for the nystagmus. This finding indicates that hyperventilation resulted in a transient increase in activity from these partially demyelinated axons.},

  Abstract                 = {Polar cross correlation is commonly used for determination of ocular torsion from video images, but breaks down at eccentric positions if the spherical geometry of the eye is not considered. We have extended this method to allow three-dimensional eye position measurement over a range of +/- 20 deg by determining the correct projection of the eye onto the image plane of the camera. We also determine the orientation of the camera with respect to the eye, allowing eye position to be represented in appropriate head-fixed coordinates. These algorithms have been validated using both in vitro and in vivo measures of eye position.},

In this method, we track iris features that have been identified as Maximally Stable Volumes. These features, which are stable over time, are dark regions with bright borders that are steep in intensity. The advantage of Maximally Stable Volumes is that they are robust to nonuniform illumination and to large changes in eye and camera position. The method performs well even when the iris is partially occluded by reflections or eyelids, and is faster than cross-correlation. In addition, it is possible to use the method on videos of macaque eyes taken in the infrared, where the iris appears almost featureless.},

They were 0.5 to 5 years after only 1 documented stroke, were able to walk with or without a cane, were able to grasp with the affected hand, and scored more than 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination.One session of body-weight-supported treadmill walking for 20 minutes at 70\% of estimated heart rate reserve or level 13 on the Borg rating of perceived exertion scale. The control condition consisted of a 20-minute review of a home exercise program with a physiotherapist.Cognitive tests included Trail Making Tests Parts A and B, Symbol Digit Substitution Test, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) measured hemiplegic upper-extremity motor skill.Treadmill exercise improved movement of the hemiplegic upper extremity (P=.04) but not cognitive performance. The improvement in the ARAT occurred without a change in strength (measured by grip strength) and was negatively correlated with maximum treadmill speed (R(2)=.20; P=.04).These findings suggest that acute treadmill exercise improves subsequent skilled movement of the hemiplegic upper extremity that seems unrelated to attention, visuomotor processing, or strength. The etiology and duration of this enhancing effect are worth further study. The existence of an exercise-cognition relationship in people with stroke is an intriguing area of future research.},

One of the main reasons is unresolved technical difficulties in the analysis of video-based images of the eye. Based on simulations, we present solutions to two of the primary problems: a robust and reliable calibration of horizontal and vertical eye movement recordings, and the extraction of suitable iris patterns for the determination of the torsional eye position component.},

These so-called "Listing planes" for eye-in-space and head-in-space rotations are workspace-oriented, not body-fixed. Eye and head trajectories in their respective planes are closely related in direction and amplitude. For pointing or grasping, the rotatory trajectories of the arm are also restricted to a workspace-oriented Listing plane. During visually guided movements, arm follows gaze, and the nine-dimensional rotatory configuration space for eye-head-arm-synergies (three degrees of freedom for each system) is reduced to a two-dimensional plane in the space of quaternion vectors.},

  Abstract                 = {Juvenile rhesus monkeys, placed on a motorized turntable, were rotated at constant velocity and then decelerated about an Earth-vertical axis. The animals were implanted with dual search coils to measure eye movements in three dimensions. By changing the monkey's body position (upright, ear-down, supine), postrotatory nystagmus was elicited in the horizontal, vertical, or torsional direction. Peak slow phase eye velocity and time constant of velocity decay were compared between decelerations in the dark and in the light. In all nystagmus directions, illumination reduced the time constant (Tc) to values around 5 sec. Peak velocity (Vp) was markedly attenuated in the horizontal and vertical directions (around 50\%), but the effect of light on Vp in the torsional direction was small (less than 20\%). These findings were independent of the velocity step size. Our hypothesis is that the two dynamic components of optokinetic nystagmus, as they interact with postrotatory nystagmus during visual suppression, differ in their dimensionality: the early component (fast component, direct pathway, pursuit system) is mainly activated in the horizontal and vertical directions, while the late component (slow component, indirect pathway, optokinetic system) effectively operates in all three dimensions.},

  Abstract                 = {Horizontal and vertical movements of the human eye bring new objects to the center of the visual field, but torsional movements rotate the visual world about its center. Ocular torsion stays near zero during head-fixed gaze shifts, and eye movements to visual targets are thought to be driven by purely horizontal and vertical commands. Here, analysis of eye-head gaze shifts revealed that gaze commands were three-dimensional, with a separate neural control system for torsion. Active torsion optimized gaze control as no two-dimensional system could have, stabilizing the retinal image as quickly as possible when it would otherwise have spun around the fixation point.},

  Abstract                 = {In non-commutative algebra, order makes a difference to multiplication, so that a x b not equal to b x a. This feature is necessary for computing rotary motion, because order makes a difference to the combined effect of two rotations. It has therefore been proposed that there are non-commutative operators in the brain circuits that deal with rotations, including motor circuits that steer the eyes, head and limbs, and sensory circuits that handle spatial information. This idea is controversial: studies of eye and head control have revealed behaviours that are consistent with non-commutativity in the brain, but none that clearly rules out all commutative models. Here we demonstrate non-commutative computation in the vestibulo-ocular reflex. We show that subjects rotated in darkness can hold their gaze points stable in space, correctly computing different final eye-position commands when put through the same two rotations in different orders, in a way that is unattainable by any commutative system.},

  Abstract                 = {To explain the positive Bielschowsky head-tilt (BHT) sign in unilateral trochlear nerve palsy (uTNP) by the kinematics of three-dimensional eye rotations.Twelve patients with uTNP monocularly fixed on targets on a Hess screen were oscillated (+/- 35 degrees, 0.3 Hz) about the roll axis on a motorized turntable (dynamic BHT). Three-dimensional eye movements were recorded with dual search coils. Normal data were collected from 11 healthy subjects.The rotation axis of the viewing paretic or unaffected eye was nearly parallel to the line of sight. The rotation axis of the covered fellow eye, however, was tilted inward relative to the other axis. This convergence of axes increased with gaze toward the unaffected side. Over entire cycles of head roll, the rotation axis of either eye remained relatively stable in both the viewing and covered conditions.In patients with uTNP, circular gaze trajectories of the covered paretic or unaffected eye during dynamic BHT are a direct consequence of the nasal deviation of the rotation axis from the line of sight. This, in turn, is a geometrical result of decreased force by the superior oblique muscle (SO) of the covered paretic eye or, according to Hering's law, increased force parallel to the paretic SO in the covered unaffected eye. The horizontal incomitance of rotation axes along horizontal eye positions can be explained by the same mechanism.},

We asked whether this law had similar consequences on the orientation of ocular rotation axes. Patients with unilateral trochlear nerve palsy were oscillated about the nasooccipital (= roll) axis (+/-35 degrees, 0.3 Hz), and monocularly fixed on targets on a head-fixed Hess screen. Both the covered and uncovered eyes were measured with dual search coils. The rotation axis of the covered eye (paretic or healthy) tilted more nasally from the line of sight when gaze was directed toward the side of the healthy eye. The rotation axis of the viewing eye (paretic or healthy), however, remained roughly aligned with the line of sight. We conclude that incomitance due to eye muscle palsy extends to ocular rotation axes during vestibular stimulation.},

  Abstract                 = {We determined the spatial dependence of adaptive gain changes of the vertical angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) on gravity in five human subjects. The gain was decreased for 1 h by sinusoidal oscillation in pitch about a spatial vertical axis in a subject-stationary surround with the head oriented left-side down. Gains were tested by sinusoidal oscillation about a spatial vertical axis while subjects were tilted in 15 degrees increments from left- to right-side down positions through the upright. Changes in gain of the vertical component of the induced eye movements were expressed as a percentage of the preadapted values for the final analysis. Vertical aVOR gain changes were maximal in the position in which the gain had been adapted and declined progressively as subjects were moved from this position. Gain changes were plotted as a function of head orientation and fit with a sine function. The bias level of the fitted sines, i.e., the gravity-independent gain change, was -29+/-10\% (SD). The gains varied around this bias as a function of head position by +/-18+/-6\%, which were the gravity-dependent gain changes. The gravity-dependent gain changes induced by only 1 h of adaptation persisted, gradually declining over several days. We conclude that there is a component of the vertical aVOR gain change in humans that is dependent on the head orientation in which the gain was adapted, and that this dependence can persist for substantial periods.},
