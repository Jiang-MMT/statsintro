*"Statistics ist the explanation of variance in the light of what
remains unexplained."*

Statistics was originally invented - as so many other things - by the
famous mathematician C.F. Gauss, who said about his own work *"Ich habe
fleissig sein m√ºssen; wer es gleichfalls ist, wird eben so weit
kommen"*. Even if your aspirations are not that high, you can get a lot
out of statistics. In fact, if your work with real data, you probably
won't be able to avoid it. Statistics can

-  Describe variation.

-  Make quantitative statements about populations.

-  Make predictions.

**Books:** There are a number of good books about statistics:

*Douglas G. Altman. Practical Statistics for Medical Research. Chapman & Hall/CRC, 1999* 
    This is my favorite stats book. It does not talk a lot about computers
    and modeling, but gives you a terrific introduction into the field.
    Many formulations and examples in this manuscript have been taken from
    that book.

*R.H. Riffenburgh. Statistics in Medicine. Academic Press, 3rd edition, 2012* .
    A more modern book, which is more voluminous and in my opinion a bit harder to read.

*Daniel Kaplan. Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach. Macalester College, 2009*
    If you are interested in a simple introduction to modern regression modeling, check out

*Dobson AJ & Barnett AG: "An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models", 3rd ed, CRC Press(2008)*
    A very good introduction to "Generalized Linear Models". If you know
    your basic statistics, this is a good, advanced starter into statistical
    modeling.

**WWW:** On the web, you find good very extensive statistics
information in English under

A good German webpage on statistics and regulatory issues is

**Exercises:** Many examples are already solved in the text. For the use in
lectures (or for self-test), additional exercises are provided at the end of
most chapters. For lecturers, solutions to these exercises can be provided
on demand. Please contact me directly for that via email.

**PDF-Version:** A complete PDF-version of this introduction is available

Why Statistics?
---------------

Statistics will help you to

-  Clarify the question.

-  Identify the variable and the measure of that variable that will
   answer that question.

-  Determine the required sample size.

-  Find the correct analysis for your data.

-  Make predictions based on your data.

Without statistics, your interpretation of your data can be massively
flawed. Take for example the estimated number of German tanks during
World War II, also known as the *German tank problem*
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_tank_problem): from standard
intelligence data, the estimate for the number of German tanks produced
per month was :math:`1550`; in contrast, the statistical estimate from
the tanks observed led to a number of :math:`327`, which was very close
to the actual production number of :math:`342`.
